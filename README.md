# HOME AUTOMATION -Project-
This project involves the creation of an AI-powered home automation system that utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and speech-to-text technology for voice commands. The system is designed to enhance the convenience, security, and energy efficiency of a household by allowing users to control various devices and monitor environmental conditions using natural language commands.
